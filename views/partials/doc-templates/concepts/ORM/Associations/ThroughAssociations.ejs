<p>Many-to-Many through associations behave the same way as many-to-many associations with the exception
of the join table being automatically created for you. This allows you to attach additional attributes
onto the relationship inside of the join table.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they are not supported yet.  Don&apos;t worry though, there&apos;s an easy workaround.</p>
<p>You can accomplish this by using an additional model as an intermediary.  Instead of a many-to-many association between two models, you can use multiple one-to-many associations through the intermediary model.</p>
