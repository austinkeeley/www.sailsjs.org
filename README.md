## Which branch do I use?
The code on the `master` branch of this repo is deployed on both sailsjs.org and preview.sailsjs.org.

## Where does this content come from?
Most content on the site (including documentation) is pulled automatically from the [sails-docs repo](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/README.md) and compiled into HTML.

## How can I help?
The [contribution guide for the Sails project](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) has information and guidelines for contributing to the Sails website, the official documentation, and the project in general.
