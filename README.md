# sailsjs.org v1.0 branch
### An update of the current sails.js website
The purpose of this branch is to:
+ Switch over from using AngularJS for client-side routing, and use views instead so that all of the pages (especially the documentation) will be properly indexed by Google
+ Reorganize the files in a way that's easier to keep track of, and clear out those that are no longer used
